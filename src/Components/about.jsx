            This gland seal water serves three important functions: it enables the pump shaft to rotate
            within its sleeve with minimum friction, it prevents the slurry from back-flowing into the seals
            and damaging the shaft, and. it allows for a small amount of cooling of the pump shaft, which heats up as
            it rotates at high speeds.

            The purpose of a diaphragm seal is to isolate a pressure measuring instrument from the process media.
            It is often used for the most difficult measuring tasks, such as when the environment is extremely hot or
            cold, or when a process connection is difficult to attach to the measuring instrument

            Often called grease, fluid or dirt seals – close spaces between stationary and moving
            components in mechanical equipment, helping prevent lubricant escape.
            They also stop harmful contaminants from entering machinery, particularly in severe environments.
